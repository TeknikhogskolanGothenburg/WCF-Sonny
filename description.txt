Sonny Aasen Description for WCF Project

The Project is divided into 2 services:
CarService and RestService

Bindings used are basicHttpBinding for RestService and CarService
aswell as netTcpBinding on CarService

These bindings while low on security features offer the best performance
and if one requires more security you could use HTTPS with it as included
in the serviceBehavior tag in the app config, or even Transport Security.

RestService includes a Post and Get method for variety,
the post method is quite complicated to call because it needs dates as JSON
which is hard to convert to DateTime.

I've included a small Faultexception sample on authenticating the operation
GetCarsByIds(CarRequest request) this operation also features message contract
and therefor the authentication process can be sent in the header. Faultexception
lets the client in on what went wrong with the service at Exception.
