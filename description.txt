Sonny Aasen Description for WCF Project

The Project is divided into 2 services:
CarService and RestService

Bindings used are basicHttpBinding for RestService and CarService
aswell as netTcpBinding on CarService

These bindings while low on security features offer the best performance
and if one requires more security you could use HTTPS with it as included
in the serviceBehavior tag in the app config, or even Transport Security.

RestService includes a Post and Get method for variety,
the post method is quite complicated to call because it needs dates as JSON
which is hard to convert to DateTime.

I've included a small Faultexception sample on authenticating the operation
GetCarsByIds(CarRequest request) this operation also features message contract
and therefor the authentication process can be sent in the header. Faultexception
lets the client in on what went wrong with the service at Exception.

One thing i found unnecessary was having essentially two classes for booking,
car, customer. These 3 classes are defined in Domain space and are used for
BL and such. But to use these classes in my Service id want Datacontract on them
which I think has to be/should be within the Service project.
This lead to a ton of Type Conversions in the operations.

Originally I had planned to use a service for each type of entity such as
CustomerService, CarService, BookingService but decided there wasn't really that many
Operations needed to make that a necessity. Ideally I would rename CarService now that
it's used for almost everything to CarRentalService or something.
